            When first starting to learn programming, especially web
            development, many people get confused between Java and JavaScript.
            The names are similar, and they are both programming languages.
            However, Java and JavaScript are not the same thing; they are
            different languages used for different purposes. The goal of this
            webpage is to explain the differences between Java and JavaScript
            and to help you understand why and how they differ when applied to
            web development.

            When working with web development, you will often hear about HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript. These are the three main languages used to
            create web pages. HTML is used to create the structure of a web
            page, CSS is used to style the web page, and JavaScript is used to
            add interactivity to the web page. JavaScript is a programming
            language used to create interactive and dynamic web pages. These are
            usually used for the client-side of the application, but if you want
            to create a server-side application, you will need to use a
            different language, such as Java, PHP, Node.js, or another language.
            Additionally, it's still common to use some kind of language to
            maintain the database, such as SQL, MongoDB, or another database
            language. With those languages, you can create a full-stack
            application for a webpage.

            JavaScript, a programming language, is employed to develop
            interactive and dynamic web pages. It operates as a scripting
            language, wherein the code is written in a human-readable format and
            then interpreted by a web browser. JavaScript serves to craft
            client-side applications within a web browser environment. Its
            applications span the creation of interactive web elements like
            forms, animations, and games. Furthermore, JavaScript extends its
            utility to building server-side applications such as web servers and
            application servers. With its versatility, JavaScript is embraced by
            millions of developers worldwide.

            Java, a robust programming language, is utilized to create versatile
            and scalable software solutions across various domains. Operating as
            both a compiled and interpreted language, Java's code is written in
            a human-readable format and then compiled into bytecode, which is
            executed by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java excels in crafting
            client-side applications for desktop, web, and mobile platforms,
            offering rich graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and seamless user
            experiences. Its applications extend beyond client-side development
            to encompass server-side applications, including web servers and
            enterprise-level systems. Java's extensive ecosystem of libraries
            and frameworks supports a wide range of functionalities, from
            database connectivity to multithreading and networking. With its
            reliability, portability, and widespread adoption, Java remains a
            cornerstone of modern software development, trusted by millions of
            developers worldwide.
