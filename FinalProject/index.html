          <h2>The confusion around Java Script (JS) and Java</h2>
          <p>
            When first starting to learn programming, especially web
            development, many people get confused between Java and JavaScript.
            The names are similar, and they are both programming languages.
            However, Java and JavaScript are not the same thing; they are
            different languages used for different purposes. The goal of this
            webpage is to explain the differences between Java and JavaScript
            and to help you understand why and how they differ when applied to
            web development.

          <h2>Web context</h2>
          <p>
            When working with web development, you will often hear about HTML,
            CSS, and JavaScript. These are the three main languages used to
            create web pages. HTML is used to create the structure of a web
            page, CSS is used to style the web page, and JavaScript is used to
            add interactivity to the web page. JavaScript is a programming
            language used to create interactive and dynamic web pages. These are
            usually used for the client-side of the application, but if you want
            to create a server-side application, you will need to use a
            different language, such as Java, PHP, Node.js, or another language.
            Additionally, it's still common to use some kind of language to
            maintain the database, such as SQL, MongoDB, or another database
            language. With those languages, you can create a full-stack
            application for a webpage.

          <h2>JS and Java history</h2>

          <article class="history-articles">
            <p>
              JavaScript, born out of Netscape Communications in the mid-1990s,
              emerged as a scripting language to bring interactivity to web
              pages. Initially named LiveScript, it was swiftly rebranded to
              align with the burgeoning popularity of Java. Despite its name,
              JavaScript shares little in common with Java; instead, it grew to
              become a fundamental component of web development. Standardized by
              ECMA International as ECMAScript, JavaScript evolved rapidly,
              embracing AJAX for asynchronous communication and powering the
              rise of dynamic web applications. Today, JavaScript stands as a
              cornerstone of web development, fueling the creation of rich,
              interactive experiences across a myriad of platforms and devices
              (geeksforgeeks).

              Java, conceived by James Gosling and his team at Sun Microsystems
              in the early 1990s, has evolved from its inception to become one
              of the most influential programming languages in modern computing.
              Initially developed as a solution for consumer electronics, it
              swiftly pivoted towards the burgeoning internet landscape. With
              its promise of "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) capability, Java
              gained widespread adoption, powering everything from web
              applications to enterprise software systems. Acquired by Oracle
              Corporation in 2010, Java continues to thrive as an integral part
              of the digital infrastructure, with a vibrant ecosystem of
              libraries, frameworks, and tools supporting its community-driven
              development(romanglushach).
