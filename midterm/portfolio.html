              The objective of the Fruta and Fruta project was to deepen our
              understanding of flexbox concepts and familiarize ourselves with
              designing interfaces using Figma. Through this endeavor, we aimed
              to refine our skills in implementing flexible layouts while
              gaining proficiency in translating design mockups into functional
              web components.
