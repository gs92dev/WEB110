        <h3>CSIT Reverse Career Fair</h3>

          Johnson County Community College's CSIT programs hold a "reverse
          career fair" every semester. A reverse career fair differs from a
          traditional career fair in that, instead of employers setting up
          displays of their organizations at booths for students to approach,
          the students were at the tables marketing themselves to recruiters.
          This format makes the students the stars of the show. Students from
          the programs such as: web, game, computer science, health information
          systems, networking and cybersecurity, and computer support presented
          polished résumés and projects to potential employers. In addition to
          asking about prospective employment opportunities, students inquired
          about company culture, skills needed for success and more.
