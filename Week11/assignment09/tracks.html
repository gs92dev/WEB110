        <p>
          The Web Development and Digital Media certificates allow you to either
          move into the workforce after earning a single certificate, or
          continue to build your skills and earn additional certificates, and
          ultimately an Associate of Applied Science degree in Web Development
          and Digital Media. Each certificate/degree builds on top of a prior,
          starting with the Web Technologies Certificate. Here is a look at the
          courses in the Web Technologies Certificate, JCCC's equivalent of a
          web development bootcamp.
